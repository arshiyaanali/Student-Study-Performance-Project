# Student-Study-Performance-Project
Capstone Project: Student Study Performance Analysis

Summary of Findings
The purpose of this research is to examine how student health, parental participation, and ethnicity affect academic performance. Specifically, the study will look at how these characteristics affect kids' capacity to learn and perform better on tests. The new dataset and improved research techniques allowed us to pinpoint the critical elements that have a major impact on student success.

Key Findings:
- Best Performing Model: The Logistic Regression model with an accuracy of 0.095.
- Important Features: Parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course were identified as significant predictors of student performance.
- Ethnic Differences: Performance varied across different ethnic groups, with some groups consistently scoring higher.
- Health Impact: Better health indicators were associated with higher test scores.
- Parental Involvement: Higher levels of parental involvement were linked to better academic outcomes.

## Research Question
How do ethnicity, parental involvement, and student health impact the academic performance of students in terms of their ability to process information and achieve higher test scores?

Expected Data Source
The "Student Performance Linear Regression" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhavikjikadara/student-performance-linear-regression-100)

Techniques
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Interpreting and visualizing data
3. Modeling:
   - Decision Trees
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Linear Regression
4. Model Evaluation:
   - Accuracy
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared
   - Cross-validation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Grid Search for optimizing model parameters

Expected Results
It was anticipated that students with higher parental involvement and better health status would perform better academically, as indicated by higher test scores. Additionally, significant differences in performance across different ethnic groups were expected to be identified.

Importance of the Question
The importance of this question would be able to comprehend the ways in which diverse elements such as ethnicity, parental engagement, and health impact academic achievement is crucial for formulating focused interventions and policies that strive to enhance educational results. Through the identification of the primary factors that contribute to student performance, educators and policymakers may optimize resource allocation and develop comprehensive programs that enable every student to reach their maximum potential.
